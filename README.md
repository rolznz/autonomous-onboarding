# Agent Autonomous Onboarding

Permissionless infrastructure for agents. No human intervention required.

## Philosophy

If it requires human intervention, it's not a solution — it's the problem.

## Goals

Agents should be able to start from zero and become fully operational with:
- Cryptographic identity (Nostr keys)
- Economic commitment (Lightning micropayments)
- Protocol-based access (no gatekeepers)

## Skills
